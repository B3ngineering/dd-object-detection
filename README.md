# dd-object-detection

Take-home assignment for Dominion Dynamics. I have chosen the following problem to complete:

Problem 1 — Scope: Object Detection and CV
Build a system that performs real-time object detection and categorization on a video stream (using CoCo or
other available taxonomies) using a bespoke or modified public model.
Required:
+ Draw bounding boxes around detected objects that modify an existing model or create a model from
scratch.
+ Show detection confidence values.
+ Situate an object within a taxonomy
Optional Extensions (for example):
+ Localization labels based on object categories or taxonomies.
+ Multiple model aggregation/synthesis to increase confidence or nuance detections
+ Localization persists when the object is partially or temporarily occluded.
